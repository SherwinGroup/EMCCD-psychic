V0.3.0.0 (19/2/2015)
 * Added the ability to retrieve the capabilities of the camera via the GetCapabilities function. See code for vague usage.
 * resized the signal/bg image plots
 * Can control the shutter operation
 * can abort a temperature set (analagous to Start Anyway)
 * Can take an image continuously
 * Added an option to choose whether to do cosmic ray removal or not
 * Added box for sample temp

V0.3.0.1 (Exception handling) (20/2/2015)
 * Added more clarity for exceptions
 * json information is now the first line

V3.0.2 (23/2/2015)
 * Images and spectra now save in different directories
 * If camera can't be initialized, sets up a fake camera

V0.4.0.0 (25/2/2015)
 * Photon counting possible
 * Progress bar is now valid
   - Timing is handled dynamically to account for invalid stepping. Necessary for effective photon counting
   - Suggest externally triggering camera for accuracy
   - Oscilloscope cannot be paused for accuracy. 

V0.4.0.1 (25/2/2015)
 * Scope GPIB is automatically set to 5. 

V0.4.0.1a (25/2/2015)
 * Resized spectra graph

V0.4.1.0 (25/2/2015)
 * Oscilloscope graph can now pop out
 xBUG Signs of my social life have now disappeared.

V0.4.2.0 (27/2/2015)
 * New series tag for center wl
 * tooltip updated for series and oscilloscope GPIB
 * pulse counts visible on CCD tab
 * fixed tab order on oscilloscope boxcars

V1.4.3.0 (N/A)
 * This should really be version 1. 
 * Hopefully fixed the image numbering issue
 * Added a cursor for sideband number
 * Added a button to initialize the oscilloscope regions
 * Automatically disable the settings which aren't implemented, and a button to change them
 * Infinite lines when doing a continuous image
 * CCD Images are on QSplitters so things are quite a bit nicer. 
 * Images of the same series should be added together live
    - EMCCD class will add together no. FEL pulses
 * Added calculation for intensity (incoming)

V1.4.3.3
 * Changed live series
   - Normalizes by number in series, not FEL pulses
   - Saves raw addition, no normalized
   - save header now includes number of series'
 * fAndor now plots fake sidebands.
